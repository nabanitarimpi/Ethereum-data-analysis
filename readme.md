# Ethereum data analysis

In this project, we work on the ethereum historical data containing data from the beginning to August 2018. Ethereum is an open-source, blockchain-based, decentralized software platform used for its own cryptocurrency, ether. It enables SmartContracts and Distributed Applications (ƒêApps) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from a third party.

## Requirements

The following packages are required to run the code :
- **Python 3.7+**

- **NumPy** (`pip install numpy`)

- **pandas** (`pip install pandas`)

- **MatplotLib** (`pip install matplotlib`)

- **Seaborn** (`pip install seaborn`)

- **scikit-learn** (`pip install scikit-learn`)

- **statsmodels** (`pip install statsmodels`)

## List of files

- _**crypto_curr.ipynb**_ : This is a jupyter notebook which contains
all the codes and explanations related to the analysis.
